                commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain is a sovereign country 
                in Europe, off the north-western coast of the continental mainland. It comprises 
                England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The United Kingdom includes 
                the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, 
                and many smaller islands within the British Isles. Northern Ireland shares a 
                land border with the Republic of Ireland; otherwise, the United Kingdom is surrounded 
                by the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, the English Channel, the Celtic Sea and 
                the Irish Sea. The total area of the United Kingdom is 242,495 square kilometres 
                (93,628 sq mi), with an estimated 2020 population of more than 67 million people.</p>
